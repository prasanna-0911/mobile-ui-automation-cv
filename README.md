🧠 Clash of Clans Base Collector Bot

🚀 Overview
Clash of Clans Base Collector Bot is an AI-powered automation tool that collects Clash of Clans base layouts directly from your Android device.

It combines YOLOv5 object detection and ADB automation to:
- Detect base layouts from screenshots,
- Extract shareable base links,
- And save them automatically into a structured CSV file.

This project demonstrates skills in AI model deployment, computer vision, and automation engineering.


✨ Features
- 🧩 Detects base layouts using a custom-trained YOLOv5 model.  
- 🤖 Automates clicks, swipes, and text actions via ADB.  
- 🖼️ Captures screenshots and extracts shareable base links.  
- 📂 Saves output in clean CSV format for further use.  
- 💻 Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1️⃣ Clone Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/prasanna-0911/coc-base-collector-bot.git
cd coc-base-collector-bot
```

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3️⃣ Connect Android Device
1. Enable USB Debugging in Developer Options.

2. Connect your device via USB and authorize the computer.

3. Test connection:

```
adb devices
You should see your device ID listed.
```

4️⃣ Run the Bot
```
python src/main.py
```

🧩 How It Works
1. Screenshot Capture – The bot uses ADB to capture the current screen.

2. Base Detection – YOLOv5 model (best_windows.pt) identifies the base area.

3. Automated Interaction – The bot simulates touch inputs to open, copy, or navigate base links.

4. Result Logging – Extracted links and metadata are stored in sample_output.csv.


🧠 Model Information
1. Model: best_windows.pt (14 MB)

2. Framework: PyTorch YOLOv5

3. Dataset: Will be added later

4. Backup Link: (HuggingFace or Google Drive — To be added soon)

This model enables the bot to recognize base layouts visually and trigger the correct automation sequence.

💡 Future Enhancements
- Support for multiple base detection per screenshot.

- Include dataset and training scripts.

- Add GUI for one-click control.

- Introduce cloud upload for collected base data.
